# r-4-data-science

This repository is for code related to the [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) free digital textbook.

The plan is to go through all of the exercises there to get more comfortable with analysis in R.
For each chapter I will create a new markdown file, which will be saved in the `rmarkdown/` directory.
