# Set up

This is a simple notebook that simply sets up your R environment with the necessary packages.
By running the below, you should be ready to go for the rest of the textbook.

This list of packages is taken from [here](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/intro).

```{r setup, include=TRUE}
options(repos = c(CRAN = "https://cran.rstudio.com/"))
install.packages('knitr')
install.packages('tidyverse')

install.packages(
  c("arrow", "babynames", "curl", "duckdb", "gapminder", 
    "ggrepel", "ggridges", "ggthemes", "hexbin", "janitor", "Lahman", 
    "leaflet", "maps", "nycflights13", "openxlsx", "palmerpenguins", 
    "repurrrsive", "tidymodels", "writexl")
  )

# Global options for the document
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)

library(tidyverse)
```


### One-off examples.

As stated within the page linked above, these packages should cover most of the code.
However, there will be one-off examples.
If you run into issues where `R` is telling you that, for example, `packagex` does not exist, you should run `install.packages('packagex')`.
