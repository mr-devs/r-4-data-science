This notebook works on creating some plots with `ggplot2`.

# Load packages
```{r}
# Set global chunk options (include blocks that throw errors)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(error = TRUE)

# For data wrangling
library(tidyverse)

library(palmerpenguins) # includes the "penguins" dataset
library(ggthemes) # include ggplot themes for pretty plotting
```


## Playing with the penguins dataset

Do penguins with longer flippers weigh more or less than penguins with shorter flippers?
What does the relationship look like?

**Note**
> Note that it says tibble on top of this preview. In the `tidyverse`, we use special data frames called `tibbles` that you will learn more about soon.

## Inspect the data

```{r}
penguins
```

An alternative view that shows all columns (and they types) can use the `glimpse` method like so...

```{r}
glimpse(penguins)
```

In Rstudio, you can also use `View()` to open an interactive viewer that opens the file in another tab...

```{r include=FALSE}
# We leave this commented out as it doesn't make sense for the "knitted" version of this file
#View(penguins)
```


## Create a scatterplot of the data

Below, `aes` stands for "aesthetics."
Aesthetics are always set within the `mapping` parameter, but can consist of many things.

```{r}
ggplot(
	data = penguins, # first variable is always the data
	mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)
)
```

The plot above is blank because we have not told `ggplot2` what to place any observations on the "canvas" yet.

To do that, we need to define a `geom`: the geometrical object that a plot uses to represent data.
These are things like bars, lines, boxplots, etc.

```{r}
ggplot(
	data = penguins, # first variable is always the data
	mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)
) + geom_point() # add points!
```


## Alter the aesthetics of the data

### Color the points

We can simply add another parameter into the `aes` mapping and to color points based on penguin species.

```{r}
ggplot(
	data = penguins, # first variable is always the data
	mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species)
) + geom_point() # add points!
```


### Add fit lines

To add fit lines, we must add another geometric object, a smoothed line.
The way that this is done in `ggplot2` is with the `geom_smooth()` object.

```{r}
ggplot(
	data = penguins, # first variable is always the data
	mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species)
) + 
	geom_point() + # Add points
	geom_smooth(method = "lm") # Add a smoothed line use a *l*inear *m*odel
```

### How do we create a fit line for all data?

When you define aesthetic properties in the `ggplot` function at the _global_ level, then all of these aesthetic properties are **passed down** to "lower-level" `geom_` properties.
However, we can define `aes` properties within specific `geom_` properties so that we can apply the fit line to the entire dataset.

```{r}
ggplot(
	data = penguins, # first variable is always the data
	mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)
) + 
	geom_point(mapping = aes(color = species)) + # Add points, set color mapping here
	geom_smooth(method = "lm") # Add a smoothed line use a *l*inear *m*odel — now for the whole dataset
```

### Control `geom_` shapes

We can again set this within the specific geometric property we want to alter.

```{r}
ggplot(
	data = penguins, # first variable is always the data
	mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)
) + 
	geom_point(mapping = aes(color = species, shape = species)) + # Now set different shapes for species
	geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

### Clean up labels, use color-friendly color scale

The `labs` function helps control the labels and the `scale_color_colorblind()` can be added at the end.

```{r}
ggplot(
	data = penguins, # first variable is always the data
	mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)
) + 
	geom_point(mapping = aes(color = species, shape = species)) + # Now set different shapes for species
	geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
	labs(
    	title = "Body mass and flipper length",
    	subtitle = "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins",
    	x = "Flipper length (mm)", y = "Body mass (g)",
    	color = "Species", shape = "Species"
	) +
	scale_color_colorblind()
```


# Exercises

## 1. How many rows are in penguins? How many columns?

```{r}
nrow(penguins)
```

## 2. What does the `bill_depth_mm` variable in the penguins data frame describe? Read the help for `?penguins` to find out.

```{r}
?penguins
```

Definition:
> a number denoting bill depth (millimeters)

## 3 Make a scatterplot of `bill_depth_mm` vs. `bill_length_mm`. That is, make a scatterplot with `bill_depth_mm` on the y-axis and `bill_length_mm` on the x-axis. Describe the relationship between these two variables.

```{r}
ggplot(
	data = penguins,
) +
	geom_point(mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm))
```

Doesn't seem like there is much of a relationship at this level of analysis.

## 4. What happens if you make a scatterplot of species vs. bill_depth_mm? What might be a better choice of geom?

```{r}
ggplot(
	data = penguins,
) +
	geom_point(mapping = aes(x = species, y = bill_depth_mm))
```

Seems like the Gentoo have noticeably smaller bill depths when compared to the other species.
Bit more variance for the Adelie, as well.

## 5. Why does the following give an error and how would you fix it?

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins) + 
  geom_point()
```

This throws an error because we've not specified any aesthetics.
`ggplot` does not know how to draw the points without instructions.
We can fix this simply by telling it what to draw on the x and y axes.

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = sex, y = bill_length_mm))
```


## 6. What does the `na.rm` argument do in `geom_point()`? What is the default value of the argument? Create a scatterplot where you successfully use this argument set to `TRUE`.

```{r}
?geom_point
```

**Definition**
> If FALSE, the default, missing values are removed with a warning. If TRUE, missing values are silently removed.

We can make the same plot as before and see that it no longer raises a warning...

```{r}
ggplot(
	data = penguins,
) +
	geom_point(mapping = aes(x = species, y = bill_depth_mm), na.rm=TRUE)
```

## 7. Add the following caption to the plot you made in the previous exercise: “Data come from the palmerpenguins package.” Hint: Take a look at the documentation for `labs()`.

```{r}
?labs
```

```{r}
ggplot(
	data = penguins,
) +
	geom_point(mapping = aes(x = species, y = bill_depth_mm), na.rm=TRUE) +
	labs(caption = "Data come from the `palmerpenguins` package.")
```

## 8. Recreate the following visualization. What aesthetic should `bill_depth_mm` be mapped to? And should it be mapped at the global level or at the geom level?

![Picture from the website.](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-visualize_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png)

We want `bill_depth_mm` to control the color of the points.

To understand the different methods for the fit line, we run the below...

```{r}
?geom_smooth
```

Looks like their is a `loess` smoothing method, which seems right...


```{r}
ggplot(
	data = penguins,
	mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)
) +
	geom_smooth(method = 'loess', na.rm=TRUE) + 
	geom_point(
		mapping = aes(color = bill_depth_mm), # We add color here to avoid error from geom_smooth
		na.rm=TRUE
	)
```


## 9. Run this code in your head and predict what the output will look like. Then, run the code in R and check your predictions.

**Prediction**
> Scatterplot where x axis is the flipper length, the y axis is the body mass, and color identifies the island of the penguins. I am assuming that we're going to have something similar to the scatterplot above where we have three lines that are related to the type of penguin (which I am assuming live in different geographically locations). There will be three different lines because the color mapping is made at the global level within the `ggplot` function. The `se=FALSE` portion seems like it will remove the error bands.


```{r}
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = island)
) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
```

**What I got wrong and what I learned**

I thought the lines would be linear by default, but it seems like ggplot applies the "loess" method by default---but only for smaller datasets---because they think it looks better.

Run the below to learn more...

```{r}
?geom_smooth
```

From the `method` documentation
>  stats::loess() is used for less than 1,000 observations; otherwise mgcv::gam() is used with formula = y ~ s(x, bs = "cs") with method = "REML". Somewhat anecdotally, loess gives a better appearance, but is O(n^2) in memory, so does not work for larger datasets.


## 10. Will these two graphs look different? Why/why not?

**Answer**
> No. The reason is because the mapping/aes properties set by the `ggplot()` function are passed to all of the geometric properties at lower levels. So, because they are defined for both geometric properties in the second set of code, they will be identical.


```{r}
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)
) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
```


```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_point(
    data = penguins,
    mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)
  ) +
  geom_smooth(
    data = penguins,
    mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)
  )
```


## Note on writing code...

Basically, including `data` and `mapping` in the `gglplot` call is very declarative but a bit much.
Typically, people do not include this as we know what the first two variables are and code looks like the below...

```{r}
ggplot(
  penguins,
  aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)
) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
```

Another approach uses the `pipe` syntax, which will be discussed more later.

```{r}
penguins |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) + 
  geom_point()
```


# Visualizing Distributions

## Categorical variables

The below simply sets the height of the bars based on how many observations occurred with each `x` value.

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species)) +
	geom_bar()
```

If we want to order them by frequency, we can use a specific function for this, which is `fct_infreq`.

What this function means is that we first convert the variable to a **factor** and order the variables based on **frequency**.
The language for the function `infreq` seems weird at first, but makes more sense when you know the other similar functions:
> - `fct_inorder()`: by the order in which they first appear.
> - `fct_infreq()`: by number of observations with each level (largest first)
> - `fct_inseq()`: by numeric value of level.
>
> [source](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/reference/fct_inorder.html)



```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = fct_infreq(species))) +
  geom_bar()
```

## Numerical distributions

### Histograms

```{r}
ggplot(
	penguins, 
	aes(x = body_mass_g)) + # Place body mass on the x-axis
	geom_histogram(binwidth = 200) # Draw histrograms
```

Make sure to experiment with many binwidths!

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 20)
```

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2000)
```


### Density plots

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_density()
```


## Exercises

### 1. Make a bar plot of `species` of `penguins`, where you assign `species` to the y aesthetic. How is this plot different?

```{r}
ggplot(
	penguins,
	aes(y=species)
) +
	geom_bar()
```

```{r}
ggplot(
	penguins,
	aes(y=fct_inorder(species))
) +
	geom_bar()
```

### 2. How are the following two plots different? Which aesthetic, color or fill, is more useful for changing the color of bars?


```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species)) +
	geom_bar(color = "red")
```

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "red")
```
Putting them together makes what is going on here obvious...

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "red", color='purple')
```


### 3. What does the `bins` argument in `geom_histogram()` do?

Controls the number of bins to use in the plot.

```{r}
ggplot(
	penguins,
	aes(x=body_mass_g)
) +
	geom_histogram(bins=5)
```


```{r}
ggplot(
	penguins,
	aes(x=body_mass_g)
) +
	geom_histogram(bins=2)
```

**From documentation**
> bins: Number of bins. Overridden by binwidth. Defaults to 30.


### 4. Make a histogram of the `carat` variable in the `diamonds` dataset that is available when you load the tidyverse package. Experiment with different binwidths. What binwidth reveals the most interesting patterns?

The below is the most interesting to me, as it shows the clear grouping around specific thresholds of importance to people.
This seems to indicate the people want to get to nice clean carat threshold of, for example, .5, 1.0, 1.5, or 2.0.

```{r}
ggplot(
	diamonds,
	aes(x=carat)
) +
	geom_histogram(binwidth = .01)
```

# Visualizing relationships

This requires at least two variables...

## Numerical and categorical

Making a boxplot...

```{r}
ggplot(
	penguins, 
	aes(x = species, y = body_mass_g)
) +
	geom_boxplot()
```

**Density plots** for each species...

```{r}
ggplot(
	penguins, 
	aes(x = body_mass_g, color = species)
) +
  geom_density(linewidth = 1)
```

Filling the density plot and controling the opacity with `alpha`

```{r}
ggplot(
	penguins,
	aes(x = body_mass_g, color = species, fill = species)
) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5)
```


## Two categorical values

Here we are showing the number of each species on each island.

```{r}
ggplot(
	penguins, 
	aes(x = island, fill = species)
) +
  geom_bar()
```
However, it is hard to compare the relative population of each species on their respective islands — for example, the proportion of Adelie on the Biscoe and Dream islands — because they have an unequal amount of penguins on each.
We can normalize by the population of each island and calculate each species relative amount by using the `position='fill'` within `geom_bar`.

```{r}
ggplot(
	penguins, 
	aes(x = island, fill = species)
) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill")
```

## Two numerical variables

**Scatter plots**

We've seen these before...

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point()
```


## Three or more variables

We can really just keep piling things on...

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species, shape = island))
```

> However adding too many aesthetic mappings to a plot makes it cluttered and difficult to make sense of. Another way, which is particularly useful for categorical variables, is to split your plot into **facets**, subplots that each display one subset of the data.

> To facet your plot by a single variable, use `facet_wrap()`. The first argument of `facet_wrap()` is a `formula`, which you create with `~` followed by a variable name. The variable that you pass to `facet_wrap()` should be categorical.
>
> Here “formula” is the name of the thing created by ~, not a synonym for “equation”.

```{r}
# Build the basic framework. Remember aesthetics are passed down to geoms
ggplot(
	penguins, 
	aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)
) +
	# How we want to control the points
	geom_point(
  		aes(color = species, shape = species)
	) +
	# Create facets of each individual island
	facet_wrap(~island)
```


## Exercises

### 1. The `mpg` data frame that is bundled with the `ggplot2` package contains 234 observations collected by the US Environmental Protection Agency on 38 car models. Which variables in `mpg` are categorical? Which variables are numerical? (Hint: Type `?mpg` to read the documentation for the dataset.) How can you see this information when you run `mpg`?

Here are a few ways to check this...

1. Summary of the tibble includes types on the left

```{r}
glimpse(mpg)
```

2. This gives similar information

```{r}
str(mpg)
```

3. Apply the `class` function to all columns to output their class type.

```{r}
sapply(mpg, class)
```

### 2. Make a scatterplot of `hwy` vs. `displ` using the `mpg` data frame. Next, map a third, numerical variable to color, then size, then both color and size, then shape. How do these aesthetics behave differently for categorical vs. numerical variables?

```{r}
ggplot(
	mpg,
	aes(x = hwy, y = displ)
) +
	geom_point(
		aes(
			color = cty,
			size = cty, # These two are handled well
			#shape = cty # This throws an error because continuous variables cannot be mapped to shapes
		)
	)
```

### 3. In the scatterplot of hwy vs. displ, what happens if you map a third variable to linewidth?

You can kind of see this below but this was a badly formulated question.


```{r}
ggplot(
	mpg,
	aes(x = hwy, y = displ, linewidth = cty)
) +
  geom_point(
  	shape=21, # This makes the circles with no fill
  )
```

### 4. What happens if you map the same variable to multiple aesthetics?

What you'd expect.

```{r}
ggplot(
	mpg,
	aes(x = hwy, y = displ, linewidth = cty, color = cty)
) +
  geom_point(
  	shape=21, # This makes the circles with no fill
  )
```

### 5. Make a scatterplot of `bill_depth_mm` vs. `bill_length_mm` and color the points by `species.` What does adding coloring by species reveal about the relationship between these two variables? What about faceting by species?

I think you can sort of see it already but their is a linear relationship between the two variables.
Certainly more clear when you facet them.

```{r}
ggplot(
	penguins,
	aes(x = bill_depth_mm, y = bill_length_mm, color = species)
) +
  geom_point(
  	shape=21, # This makes the circles with no fill
  )
```


```{r}
ggplot(
	penguins,
	aes(x = bill_depth_mm, y = bill_length_mm, color = species)
) +
  geom_point(
  	shape=21, # This makes the circles with no fill
  ) +
	facet_wrap(~species)
```


### 6. Why does the following yield two separate legends? How would you fix it to combine the two legends?

```{r}
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(
    x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, 
    color = species, shape = species
  )
) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(color = "Species")
```

The reason has to do with the `labs()` call, which only labels ONE of the two aesthetic properties.
To combine them, we can simply label them both the same thing.

```{r}
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(
    x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm,
    color = species, shape = species
  )
) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(color = "Species", shape = "Species")
```

Note that if they do not match exactly, they will be again separated.

```{r}
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(
    x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm,
    color = species, shape = species
  )
) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(color = "Species", shape = "species")
```


### 7. Create the two following stacked bar plots. Which question can you answer with the first one? Which question can you answer with the second one?

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = island, fill = species)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill")
```
What proportion of each species exists on each island? Which island has more Adelie species, Dream or Biscoe?


```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species, fill = island)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill")
```
What proportion of each species are from each island?


# Saving plots

To save plots, simply add the `ggsave` function at the end with a file name.

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point()
ggsave(filename = "figures/penguin-plot.png")
```
